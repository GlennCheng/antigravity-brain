## 🤔 Why Antigravity Brain?

When you use AI coding assistants like **Gemini**, **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **Windsurf**, they generate a hidden treasure trove of artifacts — plans, task checklists, walkthroughs, implementation docs, and iteration histories — all buried in obscure directories like `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/`.

**The problem?** These files are:
- 📂 Scattered across dozens of UUID-named folders
- 🔍 Impossible to search or browse
- 📜 Have rich iteration history that's invisible
- 🧩 Disconnected from each other

**Antigravity Brain** brings these artifacts to life. It's the missing UI layer for your AI-generated knowledge base.

## ✨ Features

### 🗂️ Brain Explorer (Sidebar)
A dedicated sidebar that organizes all your AI conversation artifacts into a browsable tree view.

- **Smart Grouping** — Files grouped by Brain (conversation), with auto-detected task names from `task.md` headers
- **Brain Statistics** — Total brain count at the top, file count per brain
- **Smart Icons** — Different icons for tasks (✅), plans (📖), walkthroughs (▶️), and other files
- **Metadata Display** — File count, last modified time, and Brain ID for each entry
- **Markdown Preview on Hover** — Hover over any file to see a rich Markdown preview (first 30 lines)

### 🔍 Cross-Brain Search
Search across **all** your Brains at once — filenames and file content.

- Instant results with debounced input
- Shows `BrainName > Filename:Line` with matching line preview
- Click to jump directly to the matching line
- Access via sidebar 🔍 button or Command Palette

### 📜 File History & Diff View
Compare any two versions of a file side-by-side or unified, in source or rendered Markdown.

- **4 View Modes** — Source Unified, Source Split, Rendered Unified, Rendered Split
- **Diff Navigation** — Jump between changes with ▲/▼ buttons (or `Alt+Arrow` / `F6`/`F7`)
- **Minimap** — Canvas-rendered minimap showing diff positions (like VS Code's editor minimap)
- **Diff Status Badge** — Git-style `+44 -12` indicator showing exact line changes
- **Version Labels** — Clear labeling: `Version 1`, `Version 2`, ..., `Current`

### ⏰ Recent Activity
Quick access to your most recently modified Brain files.

- Shows last 30 modified files sorted by time
- One-click to open any file
- Access via sidebar ⏰ button or Command Palette

### 🕸️ Knowledge Graph (Mind Map)
An interactive force-directed graph visualizing connections between your Brain files.

- Powered by **ReactFlow** + **Dagre** layout
- Supports Markdown links `[Title](./file.md)` and Wiki-links `[[Page Name]]`
- Click nodes to navigate to files
